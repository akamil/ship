##ANTLR3 grammar that reads config files and spits out Ruby objects

##The goal is to enhance Ruby command-line shell (e.g. Rush:
http://rush.heroku.com/) with a native config interpreter/query parser
and some logistics commands for filtering and shipping the data back
and forth, for now it is an early stand-alone version

##Based on Fig generic configuration parser (in Java)  by Terrence
Parr : http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Fig+-+Generic+configuration+language+interpreter
(ours is essentially a Ruby port with some grammar modifications)

##Dynamically convert Ruby hash into an object:
